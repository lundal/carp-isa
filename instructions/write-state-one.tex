\purpose

To write one state.

\description

State (Z, Y, X) in Cell BRAM A is set to STATE.

\notes

STATE is cropped to [state bits].

If row (Z, Y) is outside the defined matrix, data will still be written but only accessible by read instructions.

If X is outside the defined matrix, nothing will happen.
