\instruction{Read All States}

\wordTI{-}{0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 5}

\format

read\_state\_all()

\purpose

To retrieve the state of all cells.

\description

The states of all cells are put into the send buffer in raster order (first X, then Y, then Z).
The send buffer is word-aligned after each row by padding with 0.
If a state would be split across two words, it is instead aligned to the next word.

\notes

The execution time ($T$) for this instruction depends on [matrix depth] ($M_Z$), [matrix height] ($M_Y$), [matrix width] ($M_X$) and [state bits] ($B_S$).

$$ T = M_Z M_Y \ceil[\bigg]{ \frac{M_X}{\max \left( \floor[\big]{ \frac{32}{B_S} }, M_X \right)} } + 1 $$
