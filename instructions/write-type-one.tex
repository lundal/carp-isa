\purpose

To write one state.

\description

Type (Z, Y, X) in Cell BRAM A is set to TYPE.

\notes

Each coordinate is cropped to the bits in its matrix dimension.

TYPE is cropped to [type bits].

If row (Z, Y) is outside the defined matrix, data will still be written but only accessible by read instructions.

If X is outside the defined matrix, nothing will happen.
