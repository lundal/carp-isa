\format
write\_types(Z, Y, X, TYPES)

\purpose

To write one row (or as many can fit an instruction) of types.

\description

TYPES is a list of types in little-endian order.
It is either [matrix width] or as many can fit 224 bits in length.
Each type is [type bits] long.

The types are written to Cell BRAM A at row (Z, Y).
They are offset so the first type is written to position X within the row.
Types offset to [matrix width] or more are discarded.

The length of TYPES varies depending on [matrix width] and [type bits].
It is sent as one continuous piece spanning multiple words.
The instruction length field is adjusted accordingly.

\notes

Each coordinate is cropped to the bits in its matrix dimension.

If row (Z, Y) is outside the defined matrix, data will still be written but only accessible by read instructions.
