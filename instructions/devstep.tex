\instruction{DevStep}

\wordTI{-}{0 0 0}{1 0 0 0 0}

\format

devstep()

\purpose

To perform development on all cells.

\description

The cells in Cell Buffer A are fetched and tested against all active rules.
If a rule matches a cell, the state and/or type of the cell is changed based on the rule.
Rules of higher index override those of lower index.
The developed cells are then stored in Cell Buffer B.

The lastly matched rule of each cell is stored in Rule Number BRAM, and a list of all rules with a match is stored to the Rule Vector Buffer.

\notes

An overridden rule will be listed as having a match, but all its effects are discarded.

The execution time for this instruction depends on [matrix depth], [matrix height], [rules active] and [rules tested in parallel].

$$ T_{3D} = M_Z M_Y \frac{ R_A + 1 }{ R_{TIP} } + 6 $$
$$ T_{2D} = M_Y \frac{ R_A + 1 }{ R_{TIP} } + 4 $$
