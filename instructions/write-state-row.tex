\format
write\_states(Z, Y, X, STATES)

\purpose

To write one row (or as many can fit an instruction) of states.

\description

STATES is a list of states in little-endian order.
It is either [matrix width] or as many can fit 224 bits in length.
Each state is [state bits] long.

The states are written to Cell BRAM A at row (Z, Y).
They are offset so the first state is written to position X within the row.
States offset to [matrix width] or more are discarded.

The length of STATES varies depending on [matrix width] and [state bits].
It is sent as one continuous piece spanning multiple words.
The instruction length field is adjusted accordingly.

\notes

Each coordinate is cropped to the bits in its matrix dimension.

If row (Z, Y) is outside the defined matrix, data will still be written but only accessible by read instructions.
