\instruction{Read All Types}

\wordTI{-}{0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 7}

\format

read\_types()

\purpose

To retrieve the types of all cells.

\description

The types of all cells are put into the Send Buffer in raster order (first X, then Y, then Z).
The Send Buffer is word-aligned after each row by padding with 0.
If a type would be split across two words, it is instead aligned to the next word.

\notes

The execution time ($T$) for this instruction depends on [matrix depth] ($M_Z$), [matrix height] ($M_Y$), [matrix width] ($M_X$) and [type bits] ($B_T$).

$$ T = M_Z M_Y \ceil[\bigg]{ \frac{M_X}{\max \left( \floor[\big]{ \frac{32}{B_T} }, M_X \right)} } + 1 $$
