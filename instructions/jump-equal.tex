\wordDSI{ADDRESS}{COUNTER}{0 0 1}{1 1 1 0 1}
\wordQ{VALUE}

\format
jump\_equal(ADDRESS, COUNTER, VALUE)

\purpose

To begin execution of or jump within a program stored to internal memory if a counter matches a value.

\description

If counter COUNTER is equal to VALUE, this instructions is exactly like jump(ADDRESS).
Otherwise, it is discarded.

\notes

Accessing counter [counter amount] or higher yields undefined behavior.

A value that is longer than [counter bits] yields undefined behavior.
