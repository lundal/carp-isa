\instruction{Read Rule Vectors}

\wordDSI{N}{-}{0 0 0}{0 0 0 1 0}

\format
read\_rule\_vectors(N)

\purpose

To retrieve N rule vectors.

\description

N rule vectors are placed into the Send Buffer.
Each consists of [rule amount] bits, where the first bit (rule zero) is always 1.
The Send Buffer is word-aligned after each rule vector by padding with 0.

\example

Assume a system with [rule amount] set to 48, where rules 13 and 47 have triggered.
read\_rule\_vectors(1) will put the following words into the Send Buffer.

\wordSSSS{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}{0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1}
\wordSSSS{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}{1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}

\notes

This instruction takes [words per rule vector] * N cycles.

When there are no rule vectors available and less than N have been sent, this instruction waits.
