\instruction{Read Rule Numbers}

\wordTI{-}{0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 3}

\format
read\_rule\_numbers()

\purpose

To retrieve the last rule that triggered for each cell during the previous development step.

\description

Rule numbers for the entire matrix is put into the send buffer.
Each consists of $log_2$[rule amount] bits, sent in raster order (first X, then Y, then Z).
A value of 0 means that no rules triggered.
The send buffer is word-aligned after each row by padding with 0.
If a rule number would be split across two words, it is instead aligned to the next word.

\example

Assume a system with [matrix depth] set to 1, [matrix height] set to 3, [matrix width] set to 3 and [rule amount] set to 256.
If rule 2 triggered for the fist row, none for the second and rule 8 for the third,
read\_rule\_numbers() will put the following words into the send buffer.

\wordSSSS{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0}{0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0}{0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0}
\wordSSSS{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}
\wordSSSS{0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0}{1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0}{0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0}

\notes

This instruction takes [number of words] + 1 cycles.

% $$ rule\_bits = \lceil log_2(rule\_amount) \rceil $$
% $$ row\_words = min \left( matrix\_width, rule\_bits \right) $$
% $$ words = matrix\_depth * matrix\_height * row\_words $$
