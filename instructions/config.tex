\instruction{Configure}

\wordTI{-}{0 0 0}{1 0 0 1 0}

\format

config()

\purpose

To configure the sblock matrix.

\description

The cells in Cell Buffer B are fetched along with the LUTs corresponding to each of their types.
The LUTs and states are then written to the sblocks.

\notes

The execution time for this instruction depends on [matrix depth], [matrix height] and [lut configuration bits].

$$ T_{3D} = M_Z M_Y \frac{ 128 }{ LUT_{CB} } + 2 $$
$$ T_{2D} = M_Y \frac{ 32 }{ LUT_{CB} } + 2 $$
