\instruction{Configure}

\wordTI{-}{0 0 0}{1 0 0 1 0}

\format

config()

\purpose

To configure the sblock matrix.

\description

The cells in Cell BRAM B are fetched along with the LUTs corresponding to each of their types.
The LUTs and states are then written to the sblocks.

\notes

The execution time ($T$) for this instruction depends on [matrix depth] ($M_Z$), [matrix height] ($M_Y$) and [lut configuration bits] ($LUT_{CB}$).

$$ T_{3D} = M_Z M_Y \frac{ 128 }{ LUT_{CB} } + 2 $$
$$ T_{2D} = M_Y \frac{ 32 }{ LUT_{CB} } + 2 $$
